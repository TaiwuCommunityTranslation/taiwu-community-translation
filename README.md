# Community Translation Project for the Scroll of Taiwu

This is the prototype version, it WILL mess the game text layout.

Download the latest version from the releases. 

You can download the English Langauge files, the Chinese RAW langauge files, and the extraction tools to generate the files over at [TaiwuCommunityTranslation/taiwu-language-files-zh-hans](https://github.com/TaiwuCommunityTranslation/taiwu-language-files-zh-hans).

# Development Note
Builds are compiled against a publicized .DLL due to some problematic class nesting.
