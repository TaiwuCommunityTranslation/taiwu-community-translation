# Community Translation Project for the Scroll of Taiwu

This is the prototype version, it WILL mess the game text layout.

Download the latest version from the releases. 

You can download the English Langauge files, the Chinese RAW langauge files, and the extraction tools to generate the files over at [TaiwuCommunityTranslation/taiwu-language-files-zh-hans](https://github.com/TaiwuCommunityTranslation/taiwu-language-files-zh-hans).

# Installation Instructions
1. Download the latest release from the right side-bar.
2. Extract the contents to your Scroll Of Taiwu folder.
3. Go here [TaiwuCommunityTranslation/taiwu-language-files-zh-hans](https://github.com/TaiwuCommunityTranslation/taiwu-language-files-zh-hans) and get a copy of the repository.
4. Put the contents of the `Translations` inside the `Langauges` folder in your Scroll Of Taiwu folder.
5. You need to enable the mod from the game's main menu (Right most button, click the checkmark below the mod-name, and then click the blue button).

You can get the latest copies of the translation by simply repeating steps 3 and 4. Files that are 100% translated in the Transifex should automatically be updated.

NOTE: Event files are the only game files that get changed/replaced by this mod. If you're having issues, verify game files and rerun the mod. 

# Development Note
Builds are compiled against a publicized .DLL due to some problematic class nesting.
